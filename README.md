# VirtualWorld
Hi guys.Have you guys seen the movie matrix. 
What we are trying to build here something similar to that.We will have a world with different properties
such as climate,day,night. The world will have an over all health which decreases with increase with people's
harmful activities(here it will be a variable with harm caused by each person,more info after creating the files)
<br>

This program is being built in python <br>
As of now i just put together a simple class for defining people

some features that could be included are :
<ul>
<li>Store the data in a database so as "the world doesn't end each time we close the program"</li>
<li>give people ability to give birth to children</li>
<li>allow natural disaster to occur in the world</li>
<li>Give people behaviours that may change with age (try to give each person a unique behavior)</li>

</ul>
<h3> SUMMARY</h3>

Actually i dont have the complete idea about what we are trying to build here.
i hope by the end we might be abe to build something that no on has ever built before("only possible with your support")
<br>
feel free to make your contributions.
